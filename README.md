This repository contains projects I have worked on outside of my computer science curriculum at Valdosta State University. Hopefully, it will give a clearer insight to future employers of my capabilities for an entry-level developer position.

# about me
Hello, I'm Chad Vinning, current undergrad at Valdosta State University in south Georgia. I study computer science and I am like most people an avid fan of technology. Out of the many courses in the computer science curriculum, I have found a keen interest in web development technologies. Unfortunately, many of the web developing tools and frameworks just aren't areas of interest in the academic curriculum. That doesn't mean that they are completely absent, as the capstone of the major is a crash-course developing a web application with the ruby on rails framework. If you can imagine my hardships, I had very little experience with even the basics of web development coming into the course. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were still quite foreign to me, but at the end of the course I had pieced together much of what web development entails--and I decided that I knew I wanted to be involved in this development field after graduation.
